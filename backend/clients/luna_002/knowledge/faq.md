# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do you have vegetarian or vegan options?**
Yes! We have several delicious options. Our popular choices include the **[Insert Veggie Ramen Name]** (made with soy broth) and appetizers like **Edamame** and **Seaweed Salad**. Please check the "Vegetarian" section in the menu for more details.

**Is your meat Halal or Pork-free?**
*(Pilih salah satu sesuai kondisi resto klien Anda)*
- Option A (Jika ada Babi): Our broth is tonkotsu-based (pork), so it is **not Halal**. However, we have a chicken/vegetarian ramen option cooked in a separate pot.
- Option B (Jika No Pork): Yes! We are a **No-Pork / No-Lard** establishment. We use chicken and seafood-based broths.

**Do you accept walk-ins?**
Yes, walk-ins are welcome! However, we tend to get very busy during peak hours (Friday & Saturday nights), so we highly recommend making a reservation to avoid waiting.

**What about food allergies (Gluten, Nuts, Shellfish)?**
We take safety seriously. While we try to accommodate requests, our kitchen handles **wheat (gluten), soy, peanuts, and shellfish**, so cross-contamination is possible. Please inform our staff directly if you have a severe allergy.

**Do you offer takeaway or delivery?**
Yes, you can order takeaway directly at the counter. For delivery, find us on **[GrabFood / GoFood / UberEats]**.
